<div class="Text">
Isak ”Aspen” Larsson was born on the 19th of January 2000. He was born I Kinna, Sweden and he still lives in Kinna to this date. His interest in music started very early according to his mother. She claims that he sang the song “Bohemian Rhapsody” just 2 hours after his birth. His interest in music was put aside when he was very young because he didn’t succeed in the way he wanted. He started to play soccer instead, so he wouldn’t get bored in his free time. In the year 2017 aspen felt a need to do a “comeback” to music and so he did. His first release was the single “This is the future” and it quickly turned into a big hit among music lovers all over the world. He then continued to release more singles and he continued to grow massively thanks to songs like rakade sidor and white psycho. His biggest release so far in his career is the highly anticipated single “Welcome”, people all over the internet and social medias were talking about it and as soon it was released it became a classic. Some people compare Isak Aspen to massive producers like Avicii, Beethoven and Martin Garrix and we cant do nothing more than agree to these claims.
